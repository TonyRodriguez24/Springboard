          Hi, my name is Tony and I'm a Full-Stack Developer. I am currently at
          Springboard in their Software Engineering Career Track! I'm refining my skills and learning new ones as well that will help me pursue career in Software Engineering. I'm 26 years old and I live in Oceanside, New York and I want to help build applications that improve peoples quality of life. The language I am currently most
          proficient in is Java. Outside of coding I enjoy playing basketball,
          watching sports, going to the gym, watching movies, and playing video
          games. I'm a Knicks and Giants fan.
