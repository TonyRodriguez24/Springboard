          Hi, my name is Tony and I'm a Full-Stack Developer. I am currently at Springboard refining and learning new skills that will help me pursue a career in Software Engineering. I'm 26 years old and I live in Oceanside, New York and I want to help build applications and the like that can make people's lives easier. The languages I am currently most proficient in is Java. Outside of coding I enjoy playing basketball, watching sports, going to the gym, watching movies, and playing video games. I'm a Knicks and Giants fan.

          I'm not entirely sure what to put here because most of my time up until recently in school I didn't really know what I wanted and my grades weren't the best but not because of lack of ability. But I did some college at Hofstra (originally for accounting) and some MIS (Management Info Systems) at Old Westbury.
