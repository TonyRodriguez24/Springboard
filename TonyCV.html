          Hi, my name is Tony and I'm a Full-Stack Developer. I am currently at Springboard refining and learning new skills that will help me pursue a career in Software Engineering. I'm 26 years old and I live in Oceanside, New York and I want to help build applications and the like that can make people's lives easier.

          1. For now I can finish up my friends website and show that here, I want this to be full of projects to show off my skillset. By the end of my time at Springboard I hope to do that.

          - I'm not entirely sure what to put here because most of my time up until recently in school I didn't really know what I wanted and my grades weren't the best but not because of lack of ability. But I did some college at Hofstra (originally for accounting) and some MIS (Management Info Systems) at Old Westbury.
