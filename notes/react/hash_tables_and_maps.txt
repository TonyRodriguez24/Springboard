x Maps
    - abstract data type for mapping key value pairs
    - dictionary in python

Hash Maps
- mostly constant time
- choosing array size large enough to minimize collisions
- even with that collisions will happen

chaining
- sharing one bucket

open addressing
- linear probing 

both can get close to linear time in the worst case

x Set is just a Map without Values

JS
- sets
- objects
- Maps


python
- dictionary
- sets
- frozen set

all built on maps
