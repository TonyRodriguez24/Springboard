!! We want to separate web interface from logic !!

    - def calculate_taxes(income):
        """ Calculate taxes for this income"

    @app.route('/taxes', methods = ['POST'])
    def taxes():
    """Calculate taxes from the web form"

    income = request.form.get('income')
    owed = calculate_taxes(income)

    x we want to separate the logic so we can test it then just implement the function into the form
    - isolate the functionality in its own function
    - anything that can stand on its own as a function should be its own function
    - also might be able to reuse functions

    ! Is there too much logic in your biew function?
    ! don't need to just have one assertion in test logic
    ! remember to test failing things, like forms that dont vaildate

    x Break up your methods, if functions require multiple pieces of functionality
