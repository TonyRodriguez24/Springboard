!! Set up !!
    

? class FlaskTests(TestCase)    
x   def setUp(self):
    """Stuff to do before we run every test"""

x   def tearDown(self):
    """Stuff to do before we run every test"""

    
    Runs in order:
    setUp, test_1, tearDown
    setUp, test_2, tearDown

    - typically in set up we put things tests have in common
    - ex removing a user to database only added for testing
