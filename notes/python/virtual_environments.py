# this is convenient but can be a little bit messy

# #virtual environments

#putting all the tools fra project and associate it with that project
#if you dont need everything installed globally

#you might want to more explicitly keep track of which libraries a project needs

#creating a virtual environment

#pip install -r requirements.txt
