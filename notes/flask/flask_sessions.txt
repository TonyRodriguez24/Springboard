!! Flask Sessions !!
    - a way of storing info in browser
    - easier for devs
    - fixes some issues with cookies

    x Cookies can be tricky
    - they are just strings
    - limited by size - 4KB
    - kind of low level

    x Sessions
    - magic dictionary built on top of cookies
    - more secure in a way
    - contain information for the current browser
    - Preserve type (lists, dictionaries)
    ! sessions are signed so users can't modify data
