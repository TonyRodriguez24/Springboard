x SELECT

x FROM (1)
    select and join info from table

x WHERE (2)
    - SELECT 
        *
    - FROM 
        books
    - WHERE 
        price > 10;

x GROUP BY (3) and HAVING
    - group results into different groups
    - SELECT, COUNT(*)
        author
    - FROM 
        books
    - GROUP BY 
        publisher
    - HAVING COUNT(*)
        >= 2;


x OFFSET and LIMIT
    - bit easier
    - OFFSET used in combination with limit to paginate results
