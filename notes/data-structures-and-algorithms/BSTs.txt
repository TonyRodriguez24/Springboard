Binary search trees


- each node can have a maximum of 2 children
- right hand trial will be greater by some sorted value than the middle and left
- way better to inserting into an array with is an O(n) operation beacuse everything has to be shifted

- Binary tree and a binary search tree are different because 
a binary search tree has a rule for arrangement

x Big O run time for a binary search tree
- O(log n)

In a binary search tree, traversing means looking at every node
- different than searching, not comparing left and right. Just visiting everything.

x Traversal
