!! How to Query !!

    x GETS ALL
    - Pet.query.all()

    x GETS BY ID
    - Pet.query.get(1)
    SELECT * FROM pets WHERE id = 1;
    
    x FILTER BY
    - Pet.query.filter_by(species = "cat").all()   -    can also be .first() gives you first instance
    pass in keyword arguments where species = "cat" or name = "Blue" or hunger = 20
    can add in multiple arguments, seperate with a comma and it is read as AND.
    have to add on the .all() or .first() for it to send


    x FILTER - use double equals, more complex selections
    - Pet.query.filter(Pet.hunger == 20).all()
    - Pet.query.filter(Pet.species == 'dog').all()
    have to explicitly reference Pet.species

    x AND - you seperate by comma

    x .get(primary_key)

    x .all()
    gets all matching records as a list

    x .first()
    gets first record or None

    x .one() - you want exactly one
    gets first record or error if there is 0 or more than 1
    there should only be one thing matching the query, error otherwise

    x one_or_none()
    gets first matching record, error if > 1, None if 0
