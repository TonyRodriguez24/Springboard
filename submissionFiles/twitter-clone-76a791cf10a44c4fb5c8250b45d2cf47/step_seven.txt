x Researching and understanding login strategy

- The logged in user is being kept track of by this

@app.before_request
def load_logged_in_user():
    """If we're logged in, add current user to Flask global."""

    if CURR_USER_KEY in session:
        g.user = User.query.get(session[CURR_USER_KEY])

    else:
        g.user = None

- g comes with Flask
- app before request means it runs before each request we send to the server
- the purpose of the function is load the users data in if they are logged in
